Timing Framework 

Welcome to the Timing Framework, a library for making Java animation and timing-based control easier. 
This project provides a framework and sample code for time-based animations in Swing and SWT. 

The 1.1 "classic" version of this library is fully documented in chapters 14-15 of the book Filthy Rich Clients. 

Newer releases of the library support a default timer; are multi-thread safe; go faster; use less memory; support Android, Swing, and SWT; and have an improved API.
